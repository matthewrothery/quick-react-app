# How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal into the cloned repository folder and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` and your browser should open with the default page

# Notes
- Default port is 3800
- all requests to `http://localhost:3800/api/` will be forwarded to `http://localhost:3900/` in development
  - this is very useful for proxying request to a local REST HTTP server
